    + Generated tex uses framed package. Seems limited.

    + Use longfbox instead:

      * [[/usr/share/doc/texlive-doc/latex/longfbox/longfbox.pdf]]

    + No, there is an error when loading the package that says
      savenotes is already defined.

    + Use [[/usr/share/doc/texlive-doc/latex/tcolorbox/tcolorbox.pdf]]

    + Plus, block2 engine is broken in this version of Bookdown. Use
      block instead.
