      adivinhar $10$ vezes seguidas o lado de uma moeda que cai para
      cima quando jogada? Isto é muito difícil? Pouco difícil? Fácil?
      Por quê?

    + A great puzzle from my colleague Bill Child. A card is drawn
      from an ordinary 52 card deck, and you aim to guess what it is.

      Before making your guess, you are allowed to ask one yes/no
      question about the card.
       
      Which of the 3 questions listed here will best improve your
      odds?
      
      Is the card red?
      
      Is the card a face card?
      
      Is it the Ace of Spades?
      
      None of above is best

*** Distr. Normal

    + According to the Environmental Protection Agency, chloroform,
      which in its gaseous form is suspected to be a cancer-causing
      agent, is present in small quantities in all the country's
      $240.000$ public water sources. If the mean and standard
      deviation of the amounts of chloroform present in water sources
      are $34$ and $53$ micrograms per liter (μg/L), respectively,
      explain why chloroform amounts do not have a normal
      distribution.

*** TCL

*** IC

***** Médias e proporções
